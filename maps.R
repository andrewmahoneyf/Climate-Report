### This is the stump script to read the data and plot the maps

## read the data

## filter out North American observations

## delete the original (large data) from R workspace

## -------------------- do the following for 1960, 1987, 2014 and temp/precipitation --------------------

## select jpg graphics device

## select the correct year - plot longitude-latitude and color according to the temp/prec variable
## I recommend to use ggplot() but you can do something else
## Note: if using ggplot, you may want to add "+ coord_map()" at the end of the plot.  This
## makes the map scale to look better.  You can also pick a particular map projection, look
## the documentation.  (You need 'mapproj' library).

## close the device
